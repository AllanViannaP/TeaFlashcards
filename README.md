### **Discursive Questions**: 
There are two modes of discursive quizzes: the Riddle of the Sphinx:

And a mini-game inspired by the Zelda franchise. In the Riddle of the Sphinx, players must solve the riddle presented. In the Zelda-inspired mini-game, correctly answering the question will unlock a door.

Both minigames allow players to write down their proposed answers, encouraging active participation and critical thinking.

### **Objective Questions**: 
Two minigames have been created for objective questions.

The first is inspired by classic Pokémon games, where players have only one chance to find the correct answer to the question.

The second minigame draws inspiration from Mario platform games. In this game, players can choose their answer by jumping on the blocks that represent different alternatives.

Both minigames feature a single correct answer, which is predetermined when the question deck is created.

### **Correlation questions**
In these questions, the user must correctly correlate the items. Unlike previous question types, players can make up to three mistakes before the question is considered wrong.

In the Pokémon-inspired minigame, a series of questions appear, and the objective is to reduce the enemy's life before they can reset yours. Correct answers decrease the enemy's life, while incorrect answers decrease yours.

The Zelda-inspired minigame requires players to fit blocks into the correct boxes to progress. However, if you miss placing a block, you will lose a life.

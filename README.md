* To import a deck, it is necessary to place the .deck files inside this folder.
* It's important to note that this folder will only be created automatically after you create a deck.
* To create a question database, access the creation menu inside the program.
* After its creation, the folder can be accessed easily by opening the **"Open_Deck_Folder.bat"** file.

 > If you prefer to access the folder manually, follow the following steps:
* To open that folder, use the "windows key + R" shortcut and input %appdata% in the box that appears. 
* Then, return to the AppData folder, open the Local folder and then search for the TeaFlashcard folder.
